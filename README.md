**You Are Here** is a web application to better connect homeless individuals to resources and basic facilities around them. We are currently  in the process of developing the prototype of our application. 

# 1. Viewing Our Application
Because we are currently developing our platform, **You Are Here** is currently not hosted on any public server. We are tracking our progress through local servers and are excited to publish our application soon!
> You can view what our application currently looks like through the [video component](https://youtu.be/kuEUOAdkVGs) of our application.

# 2. Our Functionality
Our `Home` page is a scrolling website that includes tabs to different features of the website: `About`, `Resources`, `Map`, `Contact`.

## 2.1 About
Our About section provides basic information about the mission and the aims of You Are
Here. Furthermore, there is a button that is a link to the map. 

## 2.2 Resources
The `Resources` tab, provides an overview of the different types of resources our platform has consolidated in our database. There are two addition links to our `Sign-Up` and `Log-In` pages, where homelessness resource providers can create accounts and sign
in. After logging in, providers can add information to any of the resources in the database and then, this
information is automatically added to the map. We are currently working on how to screen information being updated to the system to allow for the most accurate and reliable information for homeless individuals.
> If testing our model, you can sign in with a dummy account already created with `Username:hello` and `Password:hello`. We have incorporated functionality, such that multiple accounts with the same username can not be created.

## 2.3 Map
The `Map` opens up in a new browser tab. Within the map, users can search their location by zip code, city, or state, and it will auto-populate with all resources within a certain radius of the specified location. The resources are indicated by different icons based on whether a facility is a shelter, food resource, or skills training center. We are working on how to implement a geolocation feature in the map so users do not have to input their location on their own.

## 2.4 Contact
As we are in our developmental phase, the contact information of our team members have been temporarily provided for users to reach out to us with any questions or concerns.
