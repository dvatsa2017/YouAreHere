To run You Are Here, you need to download all of the files. Then, in the ~/workspace/finalproject/
directory, you need to run "flask run" to host the web server for our website. Our home page is a scrolling
website that includes tabs to different features of the website.

On the home page of the website, there is basic information about the mission and the aims of You Are
Here. Furthermore, there is a button that is a link to the map, which also has a link as one of the tabs
on the page. Within the map, you can search your location by zip code, city, or state. Through the
Resources tab on the home page, resource providers for homeless individuals can create accounts and sign
in. You can sign in with a dummy account already created with Username:hello and Password:hello. We
have incorporated functionality, such that multiple accounts with the same username can not be created.

After logging in, you can add information to any of the resources in the database and then, this
information is automatically added to the map. Overall, these are the features of the website and how to
access them.
